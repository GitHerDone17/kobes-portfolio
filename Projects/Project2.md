# Encryption/Decryption Tool
<br> 

### Overview 
We developed an encryption/decryption tool in C. The tool was capable of encrypting text files with an encryption key defined using a hexadecimal algorithm. The tool would generate a ".something" file that could then be deciphered using the deryption tool.

### My Role
I led the developement portion of the team. I was responsible for writing all of the code to implement the functionality. I also handled testing for quality assurance.
