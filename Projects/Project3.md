# USF Master Parts Sheet Builder
<br> 

### Overview 
I developed a tool capable of helping utility service engineers build a master parts sheet for the construction of new power lines. The tool follows the Utility Standards Forum (USF), which is a guide on constructing power line assemblies to the proper standard. It conforms with the standards involved in constructing a 28kV line.

<br>

### How it works:

The 'input' area is where the user selects the required standards and quantities from the dropdown menus and hits 'add' to have them added to the parts list. 

Upon adding all of the desired standards to the material list, the user can then click 'generate pdf' to export the list and have it saved as a pdf file. The 'clear all' button will clear the lists and provide a clean slate for building a new parts list. 

The standards are stored as key/value pairs in a VBA dictionnary. Likewise, all of the button functionality and background work is handled through VBA modules.
