# 3D-Printed Kinder Toy
<br> 

### Overview 
We created a video game inspired Kinder Maxi toy. The toy was based from the Plants Vs Zombie video game and is refered to as the 'Peashooter'. It was composed of 5 pieces and could be intuitively assembled/disassembled by kids of all ages. It had a locking mechanism to store potential energy, when released it launched a small 'pea' over 2 meters with laser precision. <br><br>

### My Role
I led the 3D design portion of the project, utilizing Solidworks to create/assemble the components for the toy. Additionally, I created an animation for showcasing.
